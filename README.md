### Hi there, I'm Olisa👋

After months of immersing myself in the world of DevOps and cloud engineering, I've gone from writing my first Terraform configs to orchestrating full-scale CI/CD pipelines! My goal? Designing **secure, scalable, resilient systems** in the cloud.  

I'm actively exploring **remote opportunities** where I can contribute and grow
